== Installation ==
INSTALLATION
This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' screen in WordPress
3. Click "save changes" on the "Permalink Settings" page
4. Create a loan product on Streamlinemortgage
5. Display loan product using short code [streamlinemortgage product=1] (Product id will be at the top after you create loan product)
Other shortcodes:
Loan Calculator: [streamlinemortgage product=1]
Login:  [sl_user_gate]

Create Mortgage Product
On activation, you will be automatically be redirected to loan product creations, alternatively you will find it at streamlinemortgage->loan product (for the customizable form, use gravity form 2.4 or later)

IMPORTANT: After creating loan product, you need to go to Settings > Permalinks and click “save”. This flushes the WordPress rewrite rules. For performance reasons, the rewrite rules are only flushed either when the plugin is activated or when the Permalinks are saved. So, if you are developing with the plugin activated and adding controller routes as you go, you need to use this approach to flush the rewrite rules and use your new URL endpoints.

POST IT ON FRONTEND
Use the shortcode [streamlinemortgage product=1] where 1 is loan product id that you have created.

Submit Mortgage Application
Go to where you have put the form and fill  a loan application.
